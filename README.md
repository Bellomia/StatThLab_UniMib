# StatThLab @ UniMib
Code for the Statistical Thermodinamics Lab at UniMib [2016/17]

Literally *my first MD&MC codes*, and it shows, it *really* does. One day I'll take the time to reorganize things quite a bit, for the love of aesthetics. Efficiency it's not a concern and frankly it never will: it's matlab afterall!

----------------------------------------------------

Let's clarify that: 
- MD stands for *Molecular Dynamics*;
- MC stands for *Monte Carlo*.

The course/lab focused on using these two popular techniques to tackle a standard ---yet challenging, cause multiscale in nature--- solid state problem: the *fil rouge* being Ag adatoms drifting over fcc silver 100 and 111 surfaces, the MD simulations are meant to investigate the detailed short time-scale dynamics while the MC statistics model surface diffusion in the long time-scale, according to Transition State Theory (TST, ref. to *J. Phys. Chem. 1996, 100, 31, 12771–12800*).
