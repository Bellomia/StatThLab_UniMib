# StatThLab_UniMib
Code for the Statistical Thermodinamics Lab at UniMib [2016/17]

Literally *my first* MD & MC codes, and it shows, it *really* does. One day I'll take time to reorganize things quite a bit, for aesthetics. Efficiency it's not a concern and frankly it never will: it's matlab afterall!

----------------------------------------------------

To the uneducated: 
- MD stands for *Molecular Dynamics*;
- MC stands for *Monte Carlo*.

The course/lab was about using these two popular techniques to tackle a standard, didactic, solid-state problem: the *fil rouge* being Ag adatoms drifting over fcc silver 100 and 111 surfaces, the MD simulations are meant to investigate the detailed short time-scale dynamics while the MC statistics model surface diffusion in the long time-scale, according to *Transition State Theory* (TST).
